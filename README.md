# strava-leaderboard
A custom leaderboard tracker for my friend group’s Strava-based run/walk/hike competitions. Since Strava’s leaderboard resets weekly, this tool allows us to define a custom competition period (e.g., May 1–Aug 1) and automatically calculate total activity stats over that range, eliminating manual tracking.
